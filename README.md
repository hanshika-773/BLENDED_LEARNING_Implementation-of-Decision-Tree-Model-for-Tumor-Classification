# Implementation of Decision Tree Model for Tumor Classification

## AIM:
To implement and evaluate a Decision Tree model to classify tumors as benign or malignant using a dataset of lab test results.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
#### 1. Import Libraries

* Import pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling, modeling, and visualization.
#### 2. Load Dataset

* Load the dataset from the provided URL and explore its structure.
#### 3. Feature Selection

* Define features (X) by excluding irrelevant columns like id and set diagnosis as the target (y).
#### 4. Split Dataset

* Split the data into training and testing sets (70-30 ratio).
#### 5. Train Model

* Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
#### 6. Evaluate Model

* Predict using the test set and calculate accuracy, generate a classification report, and confusion matrix.
#### 7. Visualize Results

* Plot a heatmap of the confusion matrix to assess prediction performance.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Data Loading
url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML241EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/tumor.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Step 2: Data Exploration
# Display the first few rows and column names for verification
print(data.head())
print(data.columns)

# Step 3: Feature Selection
# Assume that the 'diagnosis' column is the target, with other columns as features
# Drop 'id' and any unrelated columns
X = data.drop(columns=['id', 'diagnosis'])  # Adjust if there are any other non-feature columns
y = data['diagnosis']  # 'diagnosis' column indicates benign or malignant

# Step 4: Data Splitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Model Training
# Initialize and train the Decision Tree Classifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
# Predicting on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy and print classification metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()

## Result:
Thus, the Decision Tree model was successfully implemented to classify tumors as benign or malignant, and the model’s performance was evaluated.
